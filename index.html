                        <p>Staghorn coral is one of the most important corals in the Caribbean. Staghorn coral can form
                            dense groups called “thickets” in very shallow water. These provide important habitats for
                            other
                            reef animals, especially fish. The greatest threat to staghorn coral is ocean warming, which
                            causes the corals to release the algae that live in their tissue and provide them food,
                            usually
                            causing death. Other threats to staghorn coral are ocean acidification, land-based sources
                            of
                            pollution, and low nutrient waters in which they thrive.</p>

                        <p>The polar bear is the largest and most powerful carnivore on land, a title it shares with a
                            subspecies of brown bear called the Kodiak bear. It has no natural predators and knows no
                            fear
                            of humans, making it an extremely dangerous animal. Polar bears usually swim underwater at
                            depths of only about 3-4.5 m (9.8-14.8 ft.). They can remain submerged for more than one
                            minute.
                            Maximum dive duration is unknown; however, the longest polar bear dive observed to date
                            lasted a
                            total of 3 minutes and 10 seconds covering a distance of 45 to 50 m (148–164 ft.) without
                            surfacing.</p>

                        <p>Clownfish live on coastal seaward reefs and in shallow and sheltered lagoons at depths of
                            1-12 m
                            (3.3-39.3 ft). Clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning that they all mature as
                            males
                            but can change their sex to female. These fish aerate the water around the tentacle of their
                            host anemone, remove waste from its oral disc, and provide nitrogenous waste that the
                            anemone
                            uses as food. Contrary to popular belief, they do not capture food for the anemone.</p>

                        <p>The Killer whale (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family.
                            It is
                            the largest member of this family. Killer whales are highly social animals; they are active
                            during the day and sleep at night. Killer whales are apex predators and are at the top of
                            the
                            food chain. They prey upon a wide range of large prey including seals, smaller whales and
                            dolphins, sea lions, different fish, sharks, squid, octopi, sea birds, sea turtles, sea
                            otters,
                            and river otters. Researchers theorize that some killer whales may have a maximum diving
                            depth
                            ranging from 258 m to 452 m (846 ft. to 1,483 ft.).</p>

                            remain underwater for an average of 8 to 20 minutes. Sea lions can dive to depths between

                            several minutes before initiating their next dive. Because sperm whales spend most of their
                            time
                            in deep waters, their diet consists of species such as squid, sharks, skates, and fish that
                            also
                            occupy deep ocean waters.</p>

                            feeder, which means it captures and consumes small organisms suspended in the water. They

                            efficiently. Their tentacles are equipped with numerous stinging cells called cnidocytes,
